- **Calculator.asm**: A basic calculator program capable of performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **CheckPrime.asm**: Checks if a given number is prime.
- **Div.asm**: Implements a division operation in LC-3 Assembly.
- **Exp.asm**: Calculates the exponentiation of a given base and exponent.
- **GetNum.asm**: Prompts the user for input and retrieves a number.
- **Mul.asm**: Implements a multiplication operation in LC-3 Assembly.
- **TriangleInequality.asm**: Verifies if three given lengths can form a triangle by satisfying the triangle inequality theorem.
- **main.asm**: Main program file that likely calls or combines the functionalities of the other programs.
- **main_test_CheckPrime.asm**: Test file for the `CheckPrime` program.
- **main_test_DIV.asm**: Test file for the `Div` program.
- **main_test_EXP.asm**: Test file for the `Exp` program.
- **main_test_MUL.asm**: Test file for the `Mul` program.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KingBaruh/AssemblyLC3.git
2. **Load into an [LC-3 Simulator](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html)**  

   Use the LC-3 Simulator to run the `.asm` files and step through each program.
